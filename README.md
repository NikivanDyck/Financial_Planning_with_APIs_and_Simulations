List of Definitions

| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
|Risk Tolerance|Every investor has their own risk toleranceâ€”the amount of risk they feel willing to take on (and still be able to sleep at night). For example, younger people tend to tolerate more investment risk, because they have a longer period of time to compensate for any investment problems.|
|Probability | a concept in statistics that describes the chance that a particular event will happen.|
|Probability distribution|a mathematical function that allows us to visualize the likelihood of probable outcomes for a particular event|
|Normal Distribution| Normal distribution is commonly knowen and illistrtaed as the bell curve. It describes a dataset where values that lie further from the mean occur less frequently than those that lie closer to the mean. In a normal distribution of numerical data, the probability that a data point equals a particular value follows the 68-95-99.7 rule. This rule states that 68%, 95%, and 99.7% (effectively 100%) of possible values lie within one, two, and three standard deviations, respectively, of the mean.|
|Confidence Interval| A range of values that will likely occur with a certain degree of confidence. The values contain the best estimate of a statistical measurement. We express the confidence interval as a percentage. People most commonly use 95% for the confidence interval.|
|The z-score|The z-score connects the confidence interval and the standard deviation. The z-score for the 95% confidence interval is 1.96, or 1.96 standard deviations from the mean. The z-score for the 99% confidence interval is 2.576, or 2.576 standard deviations from the mean. The z-score for the mean of a dataset is zero. With the z-score, we can compare the results of an analysis to a normal distribution. The higher the z-score, the further away the value is from the mean.  link https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/z-score/ |
|Simulation| Is a running instance of a model, or computer program, that imitates an existing process or system.|
|Monte Carlo Simulations| Monte Carlo simulations are designed to solve issues with predicting future outcomes by modeling the effects of uncertainty over time.| 
|Portfolio Forecasting|The process of simulating the future performance of a portfolio and trying to analyze its most probable outcome.|
